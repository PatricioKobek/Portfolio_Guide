# :books: Portfolio Guide

Welcome!

This is my Portfolio Guide where I provide documentation to my data analytics projects and other relevant material. 

What follows is an ongoing work-in-progress. As I continue to work on a variety of data sets, I’ll be adding them here along with my own unique perspective on how to tackle each project, so be sure to check back often.

I’m always available to chat at [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/patricio-kobek/) about my work, so feel free to reach out.

# Python
Python is the programming language I am currently learning. Check back for individual and guided projects you can use for your own portfolio in the future.

# Patricio’s Guides
As a lifelong educator I am committed to the principles of Open Educational Resources (OER) and strive to provide materials for teaching, learning, and research that are freely accessible, openly licensed, and can be used, changed, or shared by anyone. Projects found above will eventually be added to this section with detailed step-by-step documentation to help others develop their analytic toolkits.
